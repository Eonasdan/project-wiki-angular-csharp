Refactoring is a technique to restructure code in a disciplined way. Refactoring follows a set of rules. These rules are named and published in a catalog in a similar fashion to Design Patterns. Refactoring is not only a way to repair old code, or to make existing code more flexible, but it is also a way to write new code based on a system of best practices. Not all refactorings are useful at the outset, but many are, and knowledge of the techniques is invaluable.
