# Comment Tokens - TODO, HACK, UNDONE

When you add comments with comment tokens to your code, you automatically add shortcuts to the Task List window. Double-click any comment displayed in the Task List to move the insertion point directly to the line of code where the comment begins.

**Note**: Comments in `HTML`, `.CSS`, and `.XML` markup are not displayed in the Task List.

To add a comment hyperlink to the Task List window, enter the comment marker. Enter `TODO`, `HACK`, or `UNDONE`. Add the Comment text.

```
// TODO Fix this method.
// HACK This method works but needs to be redesigned.
```

A hyperlink to your comment will appear in the Task List in the Visual Studio development environment.
