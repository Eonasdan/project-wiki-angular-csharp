We follow a [code style guideline](/Home/Style-Guideline) and do our best to verify each PR follows this guide. This guideline came into place after the start of the project and we are doing our best to bring the rest of the application up to this standard. You will be expected to follow the guideline as closely as possible and call out guide violations when reviewing otherâ€™s PRs.

Angular components should be created with the Angular CLI, as such you need to make sure that you have the cli installed. You can do this by running `npm install @angular/cli -g` the `-g` will install it globally to your machine.

Please familiarize yourself with the [git section](/Home/Tutorials/Using-Git) of the wiki. We observe a folder structure for [branches](/Home/Tutorials/Using-Git/Branches) of `[initializes]/[ticket-number]` and require the [autocomplete](/Home/Tutorials/Using-Git/Pull-Requests) to be set on new PRs.
