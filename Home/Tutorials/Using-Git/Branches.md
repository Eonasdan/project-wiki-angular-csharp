#Branches

## Protected Branches

The `master` branch will have policies in place to prevent team members from push code directly into them. Only the Team Lead/Team Architect can approve merges and merges require code reviews to be completed. 

## Feature and Task

Each developer should create a branch for a feature or task as the begin work. Developer branches should be branched from the "master" branch and be named like this: `[initials]/[tasknumber]` and optionally a description. For example, `jp/2738-[description]`.

**Do** Follow the slash with a ticket number as available. If you don't have a ticket number you should check with the team lead.
**Do** As much as possible your PR should be for one ticket at a time.
